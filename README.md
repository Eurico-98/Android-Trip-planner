# Android-Trip-planner

The app is a simple social media platform for trip planning with the purpose of planning and sharing trips with friends. It used Google Maps API to search and select locations for a trip.
It used openweatherAPI to get the weather forecast for the locations of the trip. 
It includes the basic features of a social media app like profile creation and management, sending and receiving friend requests, taking pictures using the device camera, and sharing trips among friends. 
All the social media features are handled using MQTT for communication, and the Firebase database is used for storage.
